# Data Analyst Project: Supply Chain Management

Supply Chain Management refers to the process of coordination and management of various activities involved in the production, distribution, and delivery of goods or services from their source to the end consumer. This includes everything from sourcing the raw components, coordinating with suppliers and manufacturers, to managing all the intermediate and final delivery services.

For this project, I utilized separate Excel worksheets as raw data, each containing information on products, stores, customers, and orders.
The data was first cleaned using Excel.
The data was then analyzed and a list of KPIs were shortlisted.
MySQL was used to generate queries based on these KPIs.
Finally, the data trends and insights were visualized through interactive dashboards created using Excel, Power BI and Tableau.
